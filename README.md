Code to satisfy the Art & Logic Programming Challenge (Part 1)

This project offers a solution to the Art & Logic Programming Challenge (Part 1).
This is an Android Studio project and will work when opened as a new project inside Android Studio.

See the included file "ConvertedData.txt" for encoded/decoded test values as described in "The Art & Logic Programming Challenge" PDF.

There is one test class, AUtilsUnitTest.java, which contains test methods that verify the Encoding and Decoding Function samples values as described in "The Art & Logic Programming Challenge" PDF.

The two menu items in the app toggle between the Encode and Decode screens.
